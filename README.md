Nudity detection in Python

This python script allows a user to analyze an image for nudity. It also allows a user to color all skin pixels in an image a given color. 

Inspired by nude.js and based on the following paper :

Run as : python nude.py filename [-c]
The flag '-c' makes it color the image and save to file. 

Note:
Currently works only for .jpg images.
It is currently a fairly slow program. I am open to any suggestions for performance improvements.
